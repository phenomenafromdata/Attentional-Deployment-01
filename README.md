This repository contains code and data files from an experimental cognitive task, designed to study "Attentional Deployment" (an Emotional Regulation strategy) from human participants.

There are two folders:

* [Task](https://github.com/phenomenafromdata/Attentional-Deployment-01/tree/main/Task): contains all the code and stimuli (images) files necessary to run a session of the task. The code runs on Matlab ([https://www.mathworks.com/](https://www.mathworks.com/)) and requires Psychtoolbox ([http://psychtoolbox.org/](http://psychtoolbox.org/)).

* [DataAnalysis](https://github.com/phenomenafromdata/Attentional-Deployment-01/tree/main/DataAnalysis): contains Matlab code that implements several analyses on the data collected from human participants that performed the task.

The data required to run the analysis files can be found here: [https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/232625](https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/232625).
